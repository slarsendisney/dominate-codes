# Dominate.codes

Made by Sam Larsen-Disney & Yannis Panagis for the LevelUp Society Hackathon by ShowCode

## What is it?

[dominate.codes](http://dominate.codes) is an online multiplayer game that challenges you to solve computer science questions both against time and other players in real time. After choosing to sign as a guest or using a third party account, users can elect to create a room or join an existing room using a short code. Questions pop up on the map in random places with different shapes and answering questions correctly colours the map in your colour. The first player to dominate the map wins!
